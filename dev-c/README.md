# Implementation of a Simply Homomorphic Encryption Scheme.

Key facts:
* Integer only
* FHE


This is an implementation of a integer-only fully homomorphic encryption scheme devised by van Dijk et
al. (http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/616). 
While this scheme is certainly not the most efficient homomorphic encryption scheme devised to date,
it remains comparatively simple, which could be beneficial for those
who are interested in learning the basics of modern homomorphic
encryption schemes.
